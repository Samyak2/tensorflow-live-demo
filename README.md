# Gradient descent learning exercises

Interactive exercises used for my talk at a PES Open Source meetup (topic: Tensorflow)

Access the exercises at: https://tf.samyaks.xyz/ (or try http://samyak2.github.io/tensorflow-live-demo if that is down)

## Slides

Slides for this talk can be found [here](https://samyaks.xyz/tensorflow-meetup/) (source code is [here](https://github.com/Samyak2/tensorflow-meetup/))

## Exercises

There are 5 exercises with increasing difficulty, designed to learn the intuition behind neural networks without using technical terms.

All of the exercises are implemented using Tensorflow.js
